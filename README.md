# FlightsightFront

FlightsightFront is the website for the solution Flightsight.

On this website you can (for the moment):

* See the last 20 flights and search you're flight.
* See the review on a flight and add one 

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

If you want to have access to Flightsight Back on local start with proxy

```bash
ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
